Take a look at `test_maze.py` to see how to use the Maze class.
Structure is modeled after Geoff's Matlab implementation.

- Note: This class was renamed from Map to Maze to prevent name collisions.
- A couple bugs with indexing in the 4D case was fixed from the previous version.

Take a look at `test_pq.py` to see how to use the PriorityQueue class.

- Note: The set() function was changed to insert() to prevent name collisions.

# Dependencies
